# Strategies
    - 
Strategies are responsible for authenticating requests, which they accomplish by implementing an authentication mechanism.
Authentication mechanisms define how to encode a credential, such as a password or an assertion from an identity provider (IdP), 
in a request. They also specify the procedure necessary to verify that credential. If the credential is successfully verified, the request is authenticated.

There are a wide variety of authentication mechanisms, and a corresponding variety of strategies. Strategies are distributed 
in separate packages which must be installed, configured, and registered.

Install
Strategies are published to the npm registry, and installed using a package manager.

The following command will install passport-local, a package which provides a strategy for authenticating with a username and password:

$ npm install passport-local
The following command will install passport-openidconnect, a package which implements support for OpenID Connect:

$ npm install passport-openidconnect
Developers only need to install the packages which provide authentication mechanisms required by the application. 
This reduces overall application size by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

Configure
Once a package has been installed, the strategy needs to be configured. The configuration varies with each authentication mechanism,
so strategy-specific documentation should be consulted. That being said, there are common patterns that are encountered across many strategies.

The following code is an example that configures the LocalStrategy:

var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');

var strategy = new LocalStrategy(function verify(username, password, cb) {
  db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [ username ], function(err, user) {
    if (err) { return cb(err); }
    if (!user) { return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' }); }

    crypto.pbkdf2(password, user.salt, 310000, 32, 'sha256', function(err, hashedPassword) {
      if (err) { return cb(err); }
      if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(user.hashed_password, hashedPassword)) {
        return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' });
      }
      return cb(null, user);
    });
  });
});
Verify Function
The LocalStrategy constructor takes a function as an argument. This function is known as a verify function, 
and is a common pattern in many strategies. When authenticating a request, a strategy parses the credential contained in the request.
A verify function is then called, which is responsible for determining the user to which that credential belongs. 
This allows data access to be delegated to the application.

In this particular example, the verify function is executing a SQL query to obtain a user record from the database and, 
after verifying the password, yielding the record back to the strategy, thus authenticating the user and establishing a session.

Because a verify function is supplied by the application itself, access to persistent storage is not constrained in any way.
The application is free to use any data storage system, including relational databases, graph databases, or document stores, 
and structure data within that store according to any schema.

A verify function is strategy-specific, and the exact arguments it receives and parameters it yields will depend on the underlying authentication mechanism.
For authentication mechanisms involving shared secrets, such as a password, a verify function is responsible for verifying the credential and yielding a user.
For mechanisms that provide cryptographic authentication, a verify function will typically yield a user and a key, 
the later of which the strategy will use to cryptographically verify the credential.

A verify function yields under one of three conditions: success, failure, or an error.

If the verify function finds a user to which the credential belongs, and that credential is valid, it calls the callback with the authenticating user:

return cb(null, user);
If the credential does not belong to a known user, or is not valid, the verify function calls the callback with false to indicate an authentication failure:

return cb(null, false);
If an error occurs, such as the database not being available, the callback is called with an error, in idiomatic Node.js style:

return cb(err);
It is important to distinguish between the two failure cases that can occur. Authentication failures are expected conditions,
in which the server is operating normally, even though invalid credentials are being received from the user 
(or a malicious adversary attempting to authenticate as the user). Only when the server is operating abnormally should err be set, to indicate an internal error.

Register
With the strategy configured, it is then registered by calling .use():

var passport = require('passport');

passport.use(strategy);
All strategies have a name which, by convention, corresponds to the package name according to the pattern passport-{name}.
For instance, the LocalStrategy configured above is named local as it is distributed in the passport-local package.

Once registered, the strategy can be employed to authenticate a request by passing the name of the strategy as the first argument to passport.authenticate() middleware
:

app.post('/login/password',
  passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
  function(req, res) {
    res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
  });
In cases where there is a naming conflict, or the default name is not sufficiently descriptive, 
the name can be overridden when registering the strategy by passing a name as the first argument to .use():

var passport = require('passport');

passport.use('password', strategy);
That name is then specified to passport.authenticate() middleware:

app.post('/login/password',
  passport.authenticate('password', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
  function(req, res) {
    res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
  });
For brevity, strategies are often configured and registered in a single statement:

var passport = require('passport');
var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(function verify(username, password, cb) {
  // ...
});
Username & Password
A username and password is the traditional, and still most widely used, way for users to authenticate to a website.
Support for this mechanism is provided by the passport-local package.

Install
To install passport-local, execute the following command:

$ npm install passport-local
Configure
The following code is an example that configures and registers the LocalStrategy:

var passport = require('passport');
var LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');
var crypto = require('crypto');

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(function verify(username, password, cb) {
  db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [ username ], function(err, user) {
    if (err) { return cb(err); }
    if (!user) { return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' }); }

    crypto.pbkdf2(password, user.salt, 310000, 32, 'sha256', function(err, hashedPassword) {
      if (err) { return cb(err); }
      if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(user.hashed_password, hashedPassword)) {
        return cb(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username or password.' });
      }
      return cb(null, user);
    });
  });
});
The LocalStrategy constructor takes a verify function as an argument, which accepts username and password as arguments. When authenticating a request, 
the strategy parses a username and password, which are submitted via an HTML form to the web application. 
The strategy then calls the verify function with those credentials.

The verify function is responsible for determining the user to which the username belongs, as well as verifying the password.
Because the verify function is supplied by the application, the application is free to use a database and schema of its choosing.
The example above illustrates usage of a SQL database.

Similarly, the application is free to determine its password storage format. 
The example above illustrates usage of PBKDF2 when comparing the user-supplied password with the hashed password stored in the database.

In case of authentication failure, the verify callback supplies a message, via the message option, describing why authentication failed. 
This will be displayed to the user when they are re-prompted to sign in, informing them of what went wrong.

Prompt
The user is prompted to sign in with their username and password by rendering a form. This is accomplished by defining a route:

app.get('/login',
  function(req, res, next) {
    res.render('login');
  });
The following form is an example which uses best practices:

<form action="/login/password" method="post">
    <div>
        <label for="username">Username</label>
        <input id="username" name="username" type="text" autocomplete="username" required />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="current-password">Password</label>
        <input id="current-password" name="password" type="password" autocomplete="current-password" required />
    </div>
    <div>
        <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
    </div>
</form>
Authenticate
When the user submits the form, it is processed by a route that authenticates the user using the username and password they entered.

app.post('/login/password',
  passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login', failureMessage: true }),
  function(req, res) {
    res.redirect('/~' + req.user.username);
  });
If authentication succeeds, passport.authenticate() middleware calls the next function in the stack. In this example, the function is redirecting the authenticated user to their profile page.

When authentication fails, the user is re-prompted to sign in and informed that their initial attempt was not successful. This is accomplished by using the failureRedirect option, which will redirect the user to the login page, along with the failureMessage option which will add the message to req.session.messages.
